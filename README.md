Doing conversions for you so you donâ€™t have to google them and making
code more readable.

Having code that looks like this is meaningless

```ruby
miles = 8 * 1609.344
```

You could add comments

```ruby
miles = 8 * 1609.344 # converting meters to miles
```

But why not have this!

```ruby
8.meters.to.miles
```

You can even perform mathematical operations

```ruby
10.kilometers + 1.mile # 11.609344 kilometers
```

Handling bytes now works according to the JEDEC memory standard

```ruby
1.kb.to.b.to_f == 1024.0
```

Converting distance of arc length on Earth to an (approximate) corresponding spherical geometry angle can be done with

```ruby
1.mile.geospatial.to.degree == 0.014457066992474555
```

To switch to the IEC memory standard, force SI units with

```ruby
Alchemist::use_si = true
```

To see all the units alchemist has built in conversion for, check out the [units file](lib/alchemist/data/units.yml)

<strong>You may also register your own units</strong>

```ruby
Alchemist.register(:distance, [:beard_second, :beard_seconds], 5.angstroms)
```

Installation
------------

    gem install alchemist

Setup
-----

In order for methods like `1.meter` to work, you'll either need to setup Alchemist yourself:

```ruby
Alchemist.setup # This will load every category of measurement
```

if you only want to use one category for conversions you can load it individually (this will prevent method_missing from being overridden):

```ruby
Alchemist.setup('distance') # This will load only distance
```

Rails Warning
-------------

Rails adds some methods like `bytes` to `Numeric` so it's highly recommended that instead of trying to call `bytes` on a numeric, you should use the `measure` method:

```ruby
Alchemist.measure(10, :bytes)
```
